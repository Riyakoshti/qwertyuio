Perfect 👍
Now we’ll do **Staff Domain** the *same disciplined way* — **feature-first, role-agnostic, no shortcuts**.

Think:

> “Everything the system can do **around staff as an operational domain**.”

Staff ≠ Doctor ≠ Admin
Staff = **operations & coordination**, not clinical authority.

---

## ❌ EXPLICITLY NOT STAFF DOMAIN

To keep system safe:

* Editing medical records
* Writing prescriptions
* Approving doctor leave
* System configuration
* Role management

---

## 🧠 Key Design Insight

Staff domain:

* Is **write-heavy** for appointments
* Is **read-only** for clinical data
* Acts as a **bridge** between patients and doctors
* Must be **highly restricted**

---

## ✅ Domains covered so far

✔ Doctor
✔ Appointment
✔ Patient
✔ Staff

Only **Admin / System domain** remains.

---

## 🔜 Next logical step (your choice)

1️⃣ **Admin / System domain**
2️⃣ **Permission mapping across all domains**
3️⃣ **Database schema (ERD)**
4️⃣ **API endpoints per domain**

Tell me what you want next and we keep this clean and scalable 👌
