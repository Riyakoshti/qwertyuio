Nice, we’re moving in a **very clean direction** now 👍
Same rule again: **feature-first, role-agnostic**.

Think:

> “Everything the system can do **around a patient** as a domain entity.”

# 🧑‍⚕️ PATIENT DOMAIN — COMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY

---

## 1️⃣ Patient Profile (Core Entity)

### What this feature is

Patient as a **first-class domain object**, not just a user.

### Functionality

* Create patient profile
* Update patient details
* View patient profile
* Activate / deactivate patient
* Merge duplicate patient records (advanced)

### Core data

* Name
* DOB / age
* Gender
* Contact info
* Address
* Emergency contact
* Blood group
* Status (active/inactive)

🧠
Auth user ≠ Patient profile
(One user → one patient, but still separate concerns)

---

## 2️⃣ Patient Medical History (Read Model)

### What this feature is

Aggregated **clinical timeline** of a patient.

### Functionality

* View visit history
* View diagnoses
* View prescriptions
* View reports
* View doctor notes (read-only)

### Characteristics

* Chronological
* Immutable (no edits here)
* Built from:

  * Appointments
  * Medical records
  * Prescriptions

🚫 No creation or editing in this feature
(It’s a **projection**, not a source of truth)

---

## 3️⃣ Patient Appointments (Interaction Layer)

### What this feature is

Patient’s interaction with the appointment domain.

### Functionality

* View appointments
* View appointment details
* Track appointment status
* See doctor & slot info
* View upcoming vs past appointments

🧠
Actual creation/reschedule logic lives in **Appointment domain**.

---

## 4️⃣ Patient Self-Service Actions

### What this feature is

Things a patient can request or initiate.

### Functionality

* Request appointment
* Request reschedule
* Request cancellation
* Add reason / symptoms
* Confirm appointment (if required)

⚠️
These are **requests**, not guaranteed actions.

---

## 5️⃣ Patient Reports & Documents

### What this feature is

Patient-provided medical data.

### Functionality

* Upload reports
* View uploaded reports
* Replace report (versioned)
* Tag report type (lab, scan, etc.)

### Rules

* Reports belong to patient
* Linked optionally to appointment
* Cannot edit clinical reports created by doctor

---

## 6️⃣ Patient–Doctor Interaction (Indirect)

### What this feature is

Relationship derived from visits.

### Functionality

* View consulted doctors
* View doctor profile
* View follow-up instructions
* See recommended follow-ups

🧠
No direct “assign doctor” logic here.

---

## 7️⃣ Patient Dashboard (Derived Feature)

### What this feature is

A **summary view**, not business logic.

### Functionality

* Upcoming appointment
* Last prescription
* Pending reports
* Recent doctor notes

---

## 8️⃣ Notifications (Patient as Receiver)

### What this feature is

Patient-facing alerts.

### Events

* Appointment confirmation

(Event generation handled elsewhere)

---

## 9️⃣ Patient Preferences & Settings

### What this feature is

Non-clinical configuration.

### Functionality

* Notification preferences
* Language
* Contact method
* Consent flags

---

## ❌ EXPLICITLY NOT PATIENT DOMAIN

Very important to keep scope clean.

* Prescribing medicines
* Editing medical records
* Creating doctors
* Managing availability
* Billing logic (separate domain)

---

## 🧠 Key Design Insights (mentor-aligned)

* Patient domain is **mostly read-heavy**
* Write operations are **requests**, not authority
* Clinical data is **owned by doctor domain**
* Appointments are **shared but not owned**

---

## ✅ What we have so far

We’ve cleanly defined:

* ✔ Doctor domain
* ✔ Appointment domain
* ✔ Patient domain

Each:

* Independent
* Role-agnostic
* Reusable

---

## 🔜 Next logical domains (pick one)

1️⃣ **Medical Records domain** (very important)
2️⃣ **Staff domain**
3️⃣ **Admin / System domain**
4️⃣ **Permissions mapping across domains**
5️⃣ **DB schema per domain**

Tell me what’s next and we continue the same clean way 👌
