Perfect 👍 this is **exactly** how you should do it now.
We’ll forget roles for a moment and **focus only on “Doctor-related functionality” as a domain**.

Think of this as:

> “Everything the system can do **around a doctor** — regardless of who triggers it.”

Later, we’ll say *who can trigger what*.

# 🩺 DOCTOR DOMAIN — ALL FUNCTIONALITY (FEATURE-FIRST)

I’ll group this cleanly so implementation stays sane.

---

* Activate / deactivate doctor
* Assign department / specialization

### Data involved

* Name

🚫 Doctor cannot delete patient-uploaded reports blindly

---

## 8️⃣ Doctor Dashboard (Derived Feature)

### What this feature is

Aggregated insights for the doctor.

---

## 9️⃣ Doctor–Patient Relationship (Implicit Feature)

### What this feature is

Association between doctor and patients.

### Functionality

### What this feature is

Doctor-facing alerts.

### Functionality

* New appointment assigned

(Implementation later; feature exists conceptually)

---

# ❌ EXPLICITLY NOT DOCTOR FEATURES

This is important to avoid scope creep.

* User creation
* Billing
* Payments
* Role management
* System configuration
* Staff assignment

---

## 🧠 What we just did (important insight)

We:

* Did **NOT** say “doctor can/cannot”
* Did **NOT** check roles
* Defined **pure doctor-domain capabilities**

This is exactly what your mentor meant by **feature-first**.

---

## ✅ Next logical steps (choose one)

1️⃣ Convert this into **service classes**
2️⃣ Design **DB tables for doctor domain**
3️⃣ Map **which roles can trigger which doctor features**
4️⃣ Define **API endpoints (REST)**

Tell me what you want next and we’ll go one level deeper 👌
